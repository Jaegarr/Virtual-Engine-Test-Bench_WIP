# ðŸ§ª Virtual Engine Test Bench
*Version: v0.1.0 â€” Baseline Pipeline Check*

A **Python-based simulation tool** for internal combustion engine (ICE) development.  
This project mimics real-world engine test bench calibration â€” treating the virtual engine as if it were on a dyno.

Itâ€™s designed to start simple (steadyâ€‘state torque/power) and grow in fidelity version by version, just like a real test engineerâ€™s workflow.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Philosophy
The project is structured like a real calibration & test engineering campaign:
- Start with a baseline engine model
- Add control maps and physics incrementally (VE, spark timing, BSFC, turbo, etc.)
- Use real test workflows: RPM sweeps, parameter tuning, transient runs, fault injection
- Log and analyze data to iteratively optimize performance & efficiency

## ðŸ§± Core Components (planned)
âœ… Torque & power calculation  
âœ… Air mass flow model based on VE  
â¬œ Spark timing & knock sensitivity tuning  
â¬œ Fuel flow & efficiency (BSFC) modeling  
â¬œ Boost & turbo dynamics  
â¬œ PID control loops (idle, boost)  
â¬œ Fault injection & emissions estimation  
â¬œ CLI & later GUI / dashboard
