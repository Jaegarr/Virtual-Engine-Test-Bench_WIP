# ðŸ§ª Virtual Engine Test Bench (VETB)

**Version:** v1.0.0 â€” Empirical Combustion (âœ… complete)  
**Next:** v1.1.0 â€” Spark Timing (ðŸš§ in progress)

Python-based simulation tool for internal combustion engine (ICE) development.  
It emulates a real engine test bench workflow â€” as if the virtual engine were mounted on a dyno.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Philosophy
- Start simple: steady-state torque & power from displacement and VE  
- Build iteratively: VE maps, combustion, spark timing, turbo, emissions  
- Mimic test bench workflows: single RPM runs, WOT, RPM sweeps, fault injection  
- Track fidelity improvements: validate against real dyno data over time  
- Prioritize clean design: CLI-first, modular code, later dashboards & automation  

---

## âœ… Current Features (v1.0.0)
- CLI interface with single-point & RPM sweep simulations  
- Physics-based **Wiebe combustion model** (single-zone heat release)  
- Full **thermodynamic solver** from IVC â†’ IVO  
- Computation of **IMEP, BMEP, FMEP, PMEP**  
- **CA10/50/90** burn duration markers  
- Engine database with geometry + VE maps (no constant VE option)  
- Automatic CSV export to `/Results` (timestamped & user-named)  
- pâ€“V diagrams, torque/power/emissions plots with CA markers  
- Empirical emissions model: COâ‚‚, CO, NOx, THC from AFR & fuel flow  
- BSFC and emissions intensities (g/kWh)  
- Input validation & boundary checks

## ðŸ“Š Validation
- Default VE map: Nissan VQ35DE (3.5L NA, Nissan 350Z)  
- Model validated vs dyno torque & power curves  
- ~2% improvement in accuracy vs v0.5  
- Main discrepancy at 4500 rpm due to VVT/VVL effects not yet modeled  
- Expansion & blowdown behaviour consistent with expected SI combustion  

---

## ðŸ’¾ Data & Reporting
- Results saved as `.csv` in `/Results`  
- Timestamped filenames avoid overwriting  
- Plotting available for torque, power, pâ€“V loops, and emissions  
- Future: auto-generated reports (PDF/HTML)  

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Goals
- Learn Python through ICE calibration workflows  
- Develop calibration-engineer mindset (combustion, spark, knock, BSFC)  
- Practice modular CLI-first design patterns  
- Understand emissions formation & estimation strategies  
- Move toward reproducible, shareable simulation tools
