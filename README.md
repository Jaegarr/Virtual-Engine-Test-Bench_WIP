# üß™ Virtual Engine Test Bench
**Version: v0.5.0 ‚Äî Minimum Viable Product (in progress)**

Python-based simulation tool for internal combustion engine (ICE) development.  
It emulates a real engine test bench workflow ‚Äî as if the virtual engine were mounted on a dyno.

The project begins with a simplified torque & power model and evolves in fidelity with each version ‚Äî reflecting how a calibration engineer incrementally builds model complexity.

---

## üéØ Project Philosophy
- **Start simple**: steady-state torque & power from displacement and VE
- **Build iteratively**: layer in VE maps, fuel flow, spark timing, knock, turbo, emissions
- **Mimic test bench workflows**: single point runs, RPM sweeps, fault injection
- **Track fidelity improvements**: validate against real-world dyno data over time
- **Prioritize clean design**: CLI-first, modular code, later dashboards & automation

---

## ‚úÖ Current Features (v0.5.0 ‚Äî Minimum Viable Product)
- **CLI interface** to run single-point or RPM sweep simulations
- **Airflow, torque, power & horsepower** calculated from displacement, RPM, and **VE map interpolation**
- **DataFrame output** with values rounded to 3 decimals, ready for reporting
- **Automatic CSV export** to `/Results`, timestamped & user-named
- **Full-throttle RPM sweep** mode for curve generation  
- **Modular architecture**: simulation (`Test_Modes.py`), reporting (`Reporting.py`), and config separated
- **VE map loader** ‚Äî user can upload custom VE vs RPM/Load maps or use the built-in default (Nissan 350Z dataset)
- **Simplistic emissions model** estimating CO‚ÇÇ, CO, NOx, THC from fuel flow & AFR (empirical coefficients, user-swappable)
- **FMEP model** applied to improve torque realism
- **Input validation** for VE, RPM, displacement, units
- **Configurable test types** ‚Äî detect WOT tests automatically or prompt for throttle-position filtering
