# ðŸ§ª Virtual Engine Test Bench
*Version: v0.1.0 â€” Baseline Pipeline Complete; moving to v0.5.0*

A **Python-based simulation tool** for internal combustion engine (ICE) development.  
It emulates a real engine test bench workflow as if the virtual engine were mounted on a dyno.

The project starts with a basic torque & power model, and grows in fidelity version by version â€” mirroring how a calibration engineer incrementally refines an engine model.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Philosophy
- Start simple: steady-state torque & power from displacement and VE
- Add complexity step by step: VE maps, spark timing, knock, turbo, transient behavior
- Use test-bench style workflows: single point, RPM sweep, full-throttle, fault injection
- Validate against real engine data to track accuracy improvements
- Build modular, maintainable, CLI-first code â€” later add dashboards & automated reports

---

## âœ… Current Features (v0.1.0)
- **Python CLI driver script** with mode select: single run, RPM sweep, or exit
- **Air mass flow & torque calculation** from displacement & VE
- **Power & horsepower calculation**
- **Pretty-printed pandas DataFrame** (results rounded to 3 decimals)
- **CSV export** via `Reporting` module â€” automatic timestamp & user-defined filename/folder
- **Basic full-throttle RPM sweep** test mode
- Defensive input validation for RPM, VE, displacement
- Modular design: `Test_Modes.py` (simulation logic), `Reporting.py` (data export)
- Default export location: `/Results` folder created automatically inside the project

## ðŸ“Š Planned Validation
To demonstrate improvement:
- Validate model vs real SI engine data:
  - Torque & power curves
  - VE maps
  - Spark timing and knock data
  - Emissions if available
- Visualize differences & improvements version by version

---

## ðŸ’¾ Data & Reporting
- Export results as `.csv` via `Reporting` module
- Automatic timestamped filenames to avoid overwriting
- Default folder: `/Results` inside project (auto-created)
- Future: automatic matplotlib plots, PDF/HTML reports

---

## ðŸ“Œ Current Status
> âœ… v0.1.0 done: baseline torque/power model, single & sweep modes, data export  
> ðŸ›  Next: v0.5.0 â€” load VE map, validate against real engine data

---
