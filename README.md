# ðŸ§ª Virtual Engine Test Bench (VETB)

**Version:** v0.5.0 â€” Minimum Viable Product (âœ… complete)  
**Next:** v1.0.0 â€” Empirical Combustion (ðŸš§ in progress)

Python-based simulation tool for internal combustion engine (ICE) development.  
It emulates a real engine test bench workflow â€” as if the virtual engine were mounted on a dyno.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Philosophy
- Start simple: steady-state torque & power from displacement and VE  
- Build iteratively: VE maps, fuel flow, spark timing, turbo, emissions  
- Mimic test bench workflows: single RPM runs, WOT, RPM sweeps, fault injection  
- Track fidelity improvements: validate against real dyno data over time  
- Prioritize clean design: CLI-first, modular code, later dashboards & automation  

---

## âœ… Current Features (v0.5.0)
- CLI interface with single-point & RPM sweep simulations  
- Airflow, torque, power & horsepower from displacement, RPM, VE map interpolation  
- Automatic CSV export to `/Results` (timestamped & user-named)  
- VE map loader (custom map or default Nissan VQ35DE dataset)  
- Empirical emissions model: COâ‚‚, CO, NOx, THC from AFR & fuel flow  
- FMEP/PMEP models for internal losses  
- WOT & full-sweep plotting (torque, power, emissions curves)  
- Input validation & boundary checks

## ðŸ“Š Validation
- Default VE map: Nissan VQ35DE (3.5L NA, Nissan 350Z)  
- Model validated vs dyno torque & power curves  
- Agreement in mid-range, overprediction at low/high RPM due to constant efficiency & friction model limits  
- Continuous improvements planned (combustion, spark, transient dynamics)  

---

## ðŸ’¾ Data & Reporting
- Results saved as `.csv` in `/Results`  
- Timestamped filenames avoid overwriting  
- Plotting available for torque, power & emissions  
- Future: auto-generated reports (PDF/HTML)  

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Goals
- Learn Python through ICE calibration workflows  
- Develop calibration-engineer mindset (VE, AFR, spark, knock, BSFC)  
- Practice modular CLI-first design patterns  
- Understand emissions formation & estimation strategies  
- Move toward reproducible, shareable simulation tools  

---

## ðŸ“Ž Tools & Dependencies
