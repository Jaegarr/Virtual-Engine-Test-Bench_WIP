# ðŸ§ª Digital Twin Proof-of-Concept Demonstrations

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This repository contains three proof-of-concept demonstrations and show the authorâ€™s prior independent work towards an integrated **multi-fidelity digital twin** architecture connecting:
- physics-based combustion modelling  
- machine-learning corrections from dyno data  
- CFD coupling

All simulations were performed using the authorâ€™s existing **Virtual Engine Test Bench (VTEB)** Python framework.

## ðŸ”¹ Demo 1 â€” Multi-Fuel Combustion Behaviour

**Objective:**  
Evaluate the combustion characteristics of **gasoline, hydrogen, ammonia**, and a **10 % Hâ‚‚â€“NHâ‚ƒ blend** at 3000 rpm under wide-open-throttle (WOT) conditions to assess lean-limit behaviour and fuel-specific IMEP trends.

**Methodology:**
- Single-zone Wiebe-function combustion model (Python).  
- Stoichiometric to lean operation (Î» = 0.8 â€“ 1.5).  
- Fixed burn duration beyond Î» â‰¥ 1.3 for numerical stability.  
- Fuel-specific thermochemical and laminar flame-speed correlations.  

**Results Summary:**
- Hydrogen achieved the highest IMEP (~15.6 bar at Î» = 0.8) and stable operation up to Î» = 1.5.  
- Gasoline produced intermediate IMEP (~13.4 bar at Î» = 0.8) with a near-linear lean drop-off.  
- Ammonia yielded the lowest IMEP (~13.2 bar at Î» = 0.8) due to slow kinetics and ignition energy demand.  
- A 10 % Hâ‚‚â€“NHâ‚ƒ blend increased IMEP by ~30 % vs pure NHâ‚ƒ, demonstrating hydrogen-stabilisation effects.  
- IMEP hierarchy correlated directly with flame-speed ranking (Hâ‚‚ > Hâ‚‚â€“NHâ‚ƒ > Gasoline > NHâ‚ƒ).

## ðŸ”¹ Demo 2 â€” Machine-Learning Grey-Box Correction

**Objective:**  
Demonstrate how machine learning can improve a physics-based model by correcting  
key calibration parameters to match dyno-measured torque.

**Methodology:**
- Baseline single-zone combustion model trained against experimental dyno data.  
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) used to learn residuals and correct:
  - Lambda (Î») offset,  
  - FMEP offset (mechanical loss correlation),  
  - Start-of-Combustion (SOC) timing.  
- Model retrained iteratively for accuracy improvement (v1 â†’ v1.1).

**Results Summary:**
- ML correction reduced torque deviation vs dyno from > 5 % to < 1 %.  
- Improved correlation of predicted vs measured IMEP across RPM sweep.  
- Demonstrated the feasibility of combining physics constraints with data-driven residual learning.  

**Outputs:**

## ðŸš€ Demo 3 â€” CFD-Informed Combustion Adjustment 
- Integration of hydrogen CFD data to import mean temperature (TÌ„), turbulence kinetic energy (kÌ„) and length-scale.  
- Adjusts laminar and turbulent flame-speed correlations dynamically within the VETB combustion model.

**Outputs:**  
`Demo_3_CFD_Coupling.png` â€” Torque comparison: Baseline vs ML-Correction vs Dyno.
